# Azure-IoT-Central ESP32-device

#### This example demonstrates an ESP32 S3 development board running the Azure SDK and C++ code to connect and send telemetry data (temperature and humidity) to Azure IoT Central.

#### The file Azure_IoT_PnP_Template.cpp was modified to include the code to use DHT22 sensor, to capture temperature and humidity telemetry. 
#### All other default telemetry information originaly included in the Azure SDK was removed from the file Azure_IoT_PnP_Template.cpp.
#### Omly the DHT22 sensor Temperature and Humidity telemetry is sent to the Azure IoT central after this modification
